# F95zone game manager

Maybe good idea

Now that this is independent from uni work... Time to make it better
and to torture myself

## Important

- Database file: AppData\Roaming\DiamondCoder\nsfwGameManager\hentai.xml
- For the online version, if the game is the final version, it gets a "âœ”" at the version column
- For VisualNovels there will be a "VN" at the name column
