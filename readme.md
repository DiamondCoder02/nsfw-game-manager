# F95zone game manager

Maybe good idea

Now that this is independent from uni work... Time to make it better
and to torture myself

## TODO

### All the things that has button but no fucntionality

    Games tab:
    - [ ] add game
    - [ ] remove game
    - [ ] update game
    - [ ] save file to different location
    - [ ] api and file refresh??? Is this needed?

    Other tab:
    - [ ] Show game info needs more options, but the first five is good
    - [ ] FAQ
    - [ ] Credits

    Settings tab:
    - [ ] darkmode
    - [ ] autofetchnewgames
    - [ ] autoUpdateGames

### Ideas

- [ ] F95zone.to support
- [ ] dlsite.com support

### Limitations and bugs

- [ ] You have to reastart the app to see edited columns
