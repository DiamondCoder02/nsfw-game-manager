## Important

- Currently java 8
- Files: AppData\Roaming\DiamondCoder\nsfwGameManager\
- (For now )2+1 languages: English(, Engwish UwU), Hungarian

If you put games from website:

- If the game is the final version, it gets a "âœ”" at the version column
- For VisualNovels there will be a "VN" at the name column
