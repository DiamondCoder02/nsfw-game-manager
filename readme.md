# F95zone game manager

Maybe good idea

Now that this is independent from uni work... Time to make it better
and to torture myself

## Important

- Currently java 8
- Files: AppData\Roaming\DiamondCoder\nsfwGameManager\
- (For now )2+1 languages: English(, Engwish UwU), Hungarian

If you put games from website:

- If the game is the final version, it gets a "âœ”" at the version column
- For VisualNovels there will be a "VN" at the name column

### Ideas

- [x] ~~F95zone.to support~~
- [ ] dlsite.com support

From Discord:
Hentai game manager: make backup of the XML file
Why...?
How about ask if they want and where to store backup. Maybe replace the save a copy button?
Simple program doesn't need complicated backup
At first start if the backup location missing ask if they want to have a backup somewhere -> handle errors with wondows and ask and fix any problem
