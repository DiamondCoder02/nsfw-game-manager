# Hentai game manager ( 0.1.1.4 )

Welcome to another game manager. The idea was simple, an easy to use manager that shows useful information and the newest infos about the stored games.

--_**Warning: I have only tested the program on windows and probably only works on Windows. I will make it compatible with other OS later.**_--

- Easy to read table, excel like design
- Small and lightweight program
