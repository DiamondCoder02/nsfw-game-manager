# F95zone game manager

Maybe good idea

Now that this is independent from uni work... Time to make it better
and to torture myself

I have tested this with my 4-500 games. Still small bugs, but it handles it without *much* problem.

## Important

- Currently java 8
- Files: AppData\Roaming\DiamondCoder\nsfwGameManager\
- (For now )2+1 languages: English(, Engwish UwU), Hungarian
- The app creates a backup of the database every time it starts(, only saves the last 10)

If you put games from website:

- If the game is the final version, it gets a "âœ”" at the version column
- For VisualNovels there will be a "VN" at the name column
