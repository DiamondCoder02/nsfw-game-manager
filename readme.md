# F95zone game manager

Maybe good idea

Now that this is independent from uni work... Time to make it better
and to torture myself

Because I'm lazy everything is handled with ids, mostly.

## Important

- Database file: AppData\Roaming\DiamondCoder\nsfwGameManager\hentai.xml
- For the online version, if the game is the final version, it gets a "âœ”" at the version column
- For VisualNovels there will be a "VN" at the name column
