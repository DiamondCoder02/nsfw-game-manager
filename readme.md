# F95zone game manager

Maybe good idea

Now that this is independent from uni work... Time to make it better
and to torture myself

Because I'm lazy everything is handled with ids, mostly.

## Important

## TODO

### All the things that has button but no fucntionality

Games tab:

- [x] ~~add game~~
- [x] ~~remove game~~
- [x] ~~update game~~
- [ ] save file to different location
- [ ] api and file refresh??? Is this needed?

Other tab:

- [x] ~~Show game info needs more options, but the first five is good~~
- [x] ~~FAQ~~
- [x] ~~Credits~~

Settings tab:

- [x] ~~darkmode~~
- [ ] autofetchnewgames
- [ ] autoUpdateGames

### Ideas

- [ ] F95zone.to support
- [ ] dlsite.com support

---

### Limitations and bugs

- [x] ~~You have to reastart the app to see edited columns~~ Not anymore
- [x] ~~If there is not a single line it table unable to add new game~~ Fixed
